We have a current PhD offer in the framework of the i-Bio inititative for Biology and its interfaces with Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering, at Sorbonne Université.

**Here is a summary of the project:**  
By generating multiple transcripts from the same gene, alternative splicing has the potential to greatly expand eukaryotic proteomes. In this doctoral project, we propose to leverage the growing body of available transcriptomics and proteomics data to generate new protein functional diversity. We will use the notion of evolutionary conservation to identify a set of alternative-splicing-induced sequence variations likely relevant to protein function. We will carefully cross this information with transcript expression and proteomics data. We will then map the identified sequence variations onto protein structures and interactions, at the level of protein domain families. We will build a probabilistic model that will learn « rules » from this curated resource to determine where and how to target a protein in order to modulate its function. We will represent the input data as graphs and will develop a suitable deep learning architecture (e.g., variational auto encoder). We will produce a knowledge base for alternative splicing and new methods for graph learning applied to proteins. The expected outcome will improve our understanding of protein functioning and help to guide protein design.

Interested candidates should apply for the program before **March 24, 2022** here: http://ibio.sorbonne-universite.fr/2022-program/.

**Selected candidates will obtain funding for 4 years:** 1 pre-doc rotation year + 3 years for the PhD project. During the first pre-doc year, they will be able to experiment with three parisian labs from the Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine and Institut du Fer à Moulin on three different subjects. They will choose their PhD subject and host lab at the end of this pre-doc year.
